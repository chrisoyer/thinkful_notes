    "6. So far, you have only used the features in the dataset. However, house prices can be affected by many factors like economic activity and the interest rates at the time they are sold. So, try to find some useful factors that are not included in the dataset. Integrate these factors into your model and assess the prediction performance of your model. Discuss the implications of adding these external variables into your model.\n"

    "\n",
    "The largest problem with adding this is that it requires finding a separate data set and integrating that information into the extant data in my notebook. One particular issue is that while I found several ways to identify the end of the recession (classically, defined as 2 consecutive quarters), house prices take longer to recover and so there is no clear-cut way to define this term. Because such large-scale macroeconomic factors occur rarely, it is not easy to do testing to avoid overfitting; this I have tried to make the use of this term conservative."
