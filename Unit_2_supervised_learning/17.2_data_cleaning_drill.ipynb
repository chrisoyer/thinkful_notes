    "In this assignment, you'll be working with the [U.S. Education Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project/home) from Kaggle. The data gives detailed state level information on several facets of the state of education on an annual basis. To learn more about the data and the column descriptions, click the Kaggle link above. \n",

    "Access this data from the Thinkful database using the following credentials:\n",

    "postgres_user = 'dsbc_student'<br>\n",

    "postgres_port = '5432'<br>\n",

    "To complete this assignment, submit a link to a Jupyter notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine all the variable types and find the fraction of the missing values for each variable.\n",
    "2. Notice that the data has a time dimension (year). For this assignment, forget about time and treat all the observations as if they're from the same year. Choose a strategy to deal with the missing values for each variables. For which variables would filling in the missing values with some value make sense? For which might tossing out the records entirely make sense?\n",
    "3. Now, take into account the time factor. Replicate your second answer but this time fill in the missing values by using a statistic that is calculated within the year of the observation. For example, if you want to fill a missing value for a variable with the mean of that variable, calculate the mean by using *only* the observations for that specific year.\n",
    "4. This time, fill in the missing values using interpolation (extrapolation).\n",
    "5. Compare your results for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th questions. Do you find any meaningful differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your work below, and plan on discussing with your mentor. You can also take a look at this [example solution](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/data-201-assignment-solutions/blob/master/model_prep_missing_values/solution.ipynb)."
