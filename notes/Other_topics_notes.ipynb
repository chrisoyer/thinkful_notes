    "Whether comparing two groups or more than two, the logic behind parametric tests comparing groups is the same: Calculate how much information in the data can be explained by belonging to groups (often by computing the difference between group means). Then calculate how much information is in the data overall (often by calculating the standard deviation). Finally, divide the variance explained in the means by the total variance to get a test statistic representing the information explained by group membership in the context of the overall variance."
