    "2. Some machine learning models assume the target variable to be normally distributed. In order to use these models, we may need to transform our target to be normally distributed.\n",
    "3. Some machine learning models are very sensitive to the relative magnitude of values. So, we may need to limit the values of the variables to some fixed range. Usually, we do this by normalizing our variables.\n",
    "4. To help our intuition and our understanding of the data, we may want to transform variables to a different unit of measurement. "
