Why is it interesting or significant? Conduct summary statistics and produce visualizations for the particular variables from the dataset that you will use.\n",

    "-  Propose further research. Lastly, make a proposal for a realistic future research project on this dataset that would use some data science techniques you'd like to learn in the bootcamp. Just like your earlier questions, your research proposal should present one or more clear questions. Then you should describe the techniques you would apply in order to arrive at an answer."

    "__Length.__ Your Report should be three to five pages long with visualizations. Short and clear is better than long and opaque.  \n",

    "__Format.__ The best format for your Report is an interactive Jupyter notebook ipynb file. However, you are welcome to use any format you like, so long as you're able to include visualizations and include (or link to) the code you use to generate your visualizations and summary statistics. If a Jupyter notebook would be too much overhead or unduly distract you from creating good content, markdown files (hosted perhaps on GitHub or as a gist), blog posts, or even Word or Google documents are acceptable."
